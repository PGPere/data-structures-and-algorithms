# Reverse an Array
Create a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Do not use any built-in methods. Return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our approach was to take the last element of the existing array and put into the first position of the new array then rinse and repeat.  Also, we believe that we only need to go through one loop the length of the original array.
