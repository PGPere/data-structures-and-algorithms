# Trees

## This is a binary tree and binary search tree (BST) implementation

## Chellenge

### Creation of node, binary tree and BST

### Definition of depth traversal methods for pre-order, in order and post order

### Each traverse method returns an array of values ordered appropriately

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

### Binary tree has O(n) complexity and BST has O(h) comlexity for time & space
