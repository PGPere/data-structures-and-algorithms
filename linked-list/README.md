# Singly Linked List
Create a Note class and Linked List Class. Note Class will have a pointer to next node. Linked List Class will have a head property and empty list upon instantiation.

## Challenge

The class should contain the following methods:

##### insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

##### includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

##### to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
Used the traverse method for two of the functions.  Big O space/time is O(n).
