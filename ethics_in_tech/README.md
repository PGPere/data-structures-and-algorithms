## Ethics in Tech

My observations on this subject are:

- Humans are responsible for developing technology.  The comment about AI taking over by itself is not logical to me. Human beings are responsible of the technology they produced.

- Resolving ethic issues in software are similar to the dilemmas that human handle everyday. In my view, we need to develop a framework for solving software dilemmas that is always refreshed.

- Truly believe that technology and ethics are forces of good, and that we can help people to live a better live with both.
