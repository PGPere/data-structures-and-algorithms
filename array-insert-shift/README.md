# Insert a value in the middle of an Array
Create a function called array-insert-shift which takes an array and a vlaue as arguments. Do not use any built-in methods. Return a new array that includes the old values plus the new value in the middle of the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to identified the mid-postion of the new array then run a loop to evaluate when to append the new value in the new array.  Only needed to go through one loop equal the length of the original array plus one.
