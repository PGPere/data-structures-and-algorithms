# Breadth-first Traversal

## Create a function called breadth first that takes a tree as an argument

## Return list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Use breadth first to travserse tree and queue to append into list. Time and space is O(n).
