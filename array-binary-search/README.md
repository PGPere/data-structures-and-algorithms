# Use BinarySearch to find the index position of a given value

Create a function called binarysearch which takes an array and a vlaue as arguments. Do not use any built-in methods. Returns the position of value in the the array.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach was to identified the mid-postion of the array then run a loop to evaluate when to delete the half of the array not neeed. This BinarySearch algorithm is O(logn)
